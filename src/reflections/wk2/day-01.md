What is Scope ?
    A variable declared outside of a function

What is Hoisting ?
    Hoisting is where variables and functions are moved to the top of the scope before the code is ran.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
    'Let' and 'const' are block scoped, 'Var' is globally scoped. 
    'Var' can be updated, and redeclared within its scope, 'let' and 'const' can be updated, but not re-declared. 'var' and 'let' can be declared without being initialized, but 'const' must be initialized.
