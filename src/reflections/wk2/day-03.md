What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
    You can use Console.Log and return.
    

Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
    The Elements Tab, it is helpfu and good for testing because whatever you change in this tab will be immediately and directly updated in the page you are viewing.

Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
    Using the Javascript Debugging panel in the Sources Tab.
