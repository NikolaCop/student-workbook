<!-- What are lifecycle hooks? What are lifecycle hooks used for? -->
Lifecycle hooks are a window into how the library you're using works behind-the-scenes. Lifecycle hooks allow you to know when your component is created, added to the DOM, updated, or destroyed.
<!-- How have you utilized lifcycle hooks in your afternoon projects? -->
We used them to draw objects to the page on loading. For example, when I click 'cars', it draws the cars on load.
<!-- What are mounting hooks? When might you use them? -->
Mounting hooks are often the most used hooks. They allow you to access your component immediately before and after the first render. They do not, however, run during server-side rendering.
Use mounting hooks if you need to access or modify the DOM of your component immediately before or after the initial render.
