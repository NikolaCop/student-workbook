<!-- What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide? -->
Unit Testing
- Unit tests allow you to test individual units of code in isolation.

Component Testing
- Component Testing frameworks gives users the ability to test their code in a reliable way while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.

End-To-End (E2E) Testing
- E2E tests validate all of the layers in your application. This not only includes your frontend code, but all associated backend services and infrastructure that are more representative of the environment that your users will be in.

<!-- What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why? -->
E2E testing seems to be the most useful judging from this article. It can test your back end and front end and make sure it is all functional. 

<!-- What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why? -->
They all seem pretty helpful, but I would say the least useful is component testing probably. So far, its been fairly easy to troubleshoot component issues in Vue without spending a lot of time on structured testing.
