<!-- What is Software Development Testing? -->
Software Development testing is supposed to test the smallest unit of code. Component testing makes sure each piece of a larger system works as intended.

<!-- What are the benefits of Testing in software development? -->
You can make sure your code works without installing the app, logging in and setting up the same conditions over and over again just to reach a certain screen and test a certain condition.

<!-- What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development? -->
Because the cost of building the entire system is usually low (waiting a few minutes for the code to compile), we don't have a strong incentive to spend the additional time and effort required to run a module by itself, so we fail to consider all the ways in which a module might fail.
