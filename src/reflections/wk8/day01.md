<!-- What function does a developer Portfolio provide? -->
It allows employers to see what sets you apart from other job seeking Developers. It also allows them to see projects of your choosing, so you can express your strengths. 

<!-- What makes a Developer Portfolio effective? -->
Increased visibility and authority, a way to prove you know your craft, a background of work allowing you to get that first position in the industry. It can also show your expertise on a subject while showing your personal brand.

<!-- What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why? -->
I'd like to include the Capstone I am currently working on (when I am finished with it), because it's an idea that I've had for a while that has sparked interest in a lot of people I have shared the idea with.
