<!-- What is the purpose of a Query String? -->

A query string allows you to pass information to and from a website by simply adding, or “appending,” that information to the end of a URL.

<!-- What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next? -->

Each key=value pair is called a query parameter. If your query string has multiple query parameters, they're separated by &.
