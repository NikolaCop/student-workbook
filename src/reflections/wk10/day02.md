Read Foundations of C# > C# List and answer the following questions
What is a List in C#?
``
A list is more or less the same thing as an Array in Javascript. Since Arrays behave differently in C#, Lists will probably be used more often.
``

What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
``
List.add is a pretty obvious one that I'd use a lot. Since Lists kind of replace Arrays, this will defintley be something I use all the time.
``

How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
``
List.BinarySearch. This method uses an index based search. Similar to using the 0 based index on Arrays in JS.
