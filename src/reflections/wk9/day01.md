Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions
 
What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
``
We are integrating Firebase to allow users to upload their own pictures, which is brand new to all of us. In addition to that, we're using the usual Vue, Bootstrap, and Sockets.
``
What went well so far?
``
So far the planning has gone well, we have a good Figma wireframe to work off of. Being able to visiually see the product helps a lot.
``
What would you do differently? Why?
``
I would spend more time working on a Trello board. We spent a lot of time on visual prototypes, which are nice, but the Trello board was a bit unorganized.
