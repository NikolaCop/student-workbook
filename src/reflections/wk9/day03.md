Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams

How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
``
Because of the short-term nature of consulting-based development projects, it is fairly common to staff a project with a smaller development team because it is a better value and fit for the organization's goals.
``
Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
``
Because 2 sprints not working in parrallel can sometimes lead to the "unattainable triangle". 
Tha above meaning, Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap. won't be Good
``

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
``
Good service Cheap won't be Fast, Good service Fast won't be Cheap, Fast service Cheap won't be Good.
It helps Teams stay on track and focus on making quality products rather than splitting up and making many components quickly, but with less quality.
