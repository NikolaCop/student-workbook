What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

    A Pseudo-Class causes things on screen to be styled differently given different conditions.
    An example of it being commonly used would be when a link displays as a different color
    when having been visited before, and not colored if it has not been.


What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

    Specificity is used for CSS to determine what rule should be applied first if there are multiple.
    It is beneficial to use if you want to target a specific element and override the load order.


What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

    Over using !important can lead to messy, hard to track code, since it does not have to adhere to load order.
