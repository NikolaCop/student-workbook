<!-- Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement? -->
``
I tried to keep the 'driver' and 'navigator' roles in my mind, from the reading on Monday.
``
<!-- What went well? -->
``
Our group was able to work really well together. Our personalities and skill strengths meshed really well for a fullstack project. 
``
<!-- What would you do differently? -->
``
I thought this weeks Checkpoint really smoothly, so I wouldnt have done a lot differently. I think on the final day, we could have planned more, since the only thing we missed was the functionality of moving tasks, which we overcomplicated at first and gave up on.
