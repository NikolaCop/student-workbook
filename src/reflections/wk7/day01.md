<!-- What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work? -->
``
Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the "driver", the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the "navigator"

<!-- What are some benefits of Pair Programming? -->
``
increased code quality, better diffusion of knowledge among the team, better transfer of skills, improved resiliency of a pair to interruptions.
``

<!-- What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming? -->
``
both programmers must be actively engaging with the task throughout a paired session, pair programming is also "programming out loud" -- if the driver is silent, the navigator should intervene.
